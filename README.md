Handwritten Digit Classifier

This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to classify handwritten digits from 0 to 9. It processes grayscale images, learns from labeled training data, and predicts labels for a test set. The model was implemented using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras.

Project Overview

This project involves training a CNN to classify 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits. Each image corresponds to one of the 10 possible digits (0â€“9). We use a supervised learning approach with training and validation sets, then generate predictions on a test set for submission.

Data Preprocessing

The code assumes a labeled training dataset (train.csv) and a test dataset (test.csv) in CSV format. Here's how the data is processed:

1. Load Dataset: Load train.csv into a DataFrame and separate features (pixel values) from labels.
2. Reshape and Normalize: Reshape images to (28, 28, 1) for grayscale and normalize pixel values to the range [0, 1].
3. One-Hot Encode Labels: Convert the labels to categorical format for multi-class classification.
4. Train-Validation Split: Split the dataset into training and validation sets (80-20 split).

Model Architecture

The CNN model consists of three convolutional layers, each followed by max pooling, and ends with two fully connected layers for classification. Here is a summary of the architecture:

model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')  # Output layer with 10 classes (digits 0-9)
])

Key Layers:
- Convolutional Layers: Feature extraction with filters.
- MaxPooling Layers: Reduce spatial dimensions, lowering computational load and controlling overfitting.
- Flatten Layer: Convert the 2D matrix to a 1D vector.
- Dense Layers: Fully connected layers, with the final layer outputting probabilities for each digit class.

Training the Model

After compiling the model with categorical_crossentropy as the loss function and adam as the optimizer, we train it for 10 epochs. Validation data is provided to monitor accuracy on unseen data:

history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_val, y_val), batch_size=32)

Evaluating Model Performance

The model's validation accuracy is computed by comparing predicted labels on the validation set with true labels:

accuracy = np.mean(y_pred_val == y_val_true)
print(f"Validation Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")

This helps verify that the model is generalizing well on data it hasn't seen before.

Generating Predictions

For the test data, we reshape and normalize the images, then generate predictions:

test_predictions = model.predict(test_data).argmax(axis=1)

The predictions are stored in a submission-ready DataFrame.

Submission

The submission.csv file is generated with two columns:
- ImageId: The index of each test sample, starting from 1.
- Label: The predicted digit label for each sample.

submission.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)
